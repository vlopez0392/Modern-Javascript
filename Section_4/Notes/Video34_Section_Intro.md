<p align = "justify">Functions are essential in programming since they allow you to create blocks of code you can execute repeatedly. In this section we will cover the following topics:</p>
- Creating basic functions 
- Function declarations vs expressions
- Arrow functions 
- IIFEs or immediately invoked function expressions 
- Scope : Lets you know what context your code is being executed.
- Execution context and call stack: Useful to understand how JS works under the hood.
