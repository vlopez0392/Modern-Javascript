<h3>What is JavaScript?</h3>
<p align = "justify">
JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the web, alongside HTML which is a markup language and is used to structure webpage content and CSS which is used to style this content. JavaScript is what brings life to the frontend or UI of a website or web app and make them dynamic.

It can also be used on the server-side to interact with databases and interact with the file system with the Node.js runtime. It is a high-level, interpreted PL that can be used in the client side as well as the server-side.

Intepreted? This means it is executed line by line instead of being compiled into machine-code first, hence it is an scripting language.

<h3>What is JavaScript used for?</h3>
<ol align = "justify">
    <li><strong>DOM manipulation:</strong> You can think of the DOM as a tree-like structure of nodes and everything on the page is a node. Every attribute, HTML tag and every piece of text is a node in the DOM. JS provides methods to dynamically change the content, style and structure of the elements in the DOM. For instance, we can:
    <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Add or remove text from a heading or div</li>
            <li>Change an element's style like the font color</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Event handling:</strong> User actions are called events and JS gives us a way to handle events. We can respond to things like:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Keyboard input</li>
            <li>Mouse clicks, hovers and drags</li>
            <li>Form submissions</li>
        </ul>
    This allows us to create very dynamic interfaces such as modals, dropdown, collapsible contents and so on.
    </li>
    <br>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Asynchronous Requests:</strong> One of the most powerful uses of JS. Used to interact with your backend servers (could be your own) or a public API such as google or youtube API. We can make HTTP requests to fetch data or submit data and this happens without needing to refresh pages.
    <br>
    <br>
    SPAs: Single page applications which are apps that load a single HTML page to make use of asynchronous requests to dynamically load and update content without needing to reload the entire page. This provides a very seamless UI experience. We can use a front-end framework such as Angular, React or Vue. We can also create them with vanilla JS.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Animations and Effects:</strong> Many different ways to create this with JSS and CSS such as libraries such as animate.css and GSAP. Allows developers to create a wide range of animations such as fading and moving elements along a path, scaling, rotating, etc.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Data manipulation: </strong> 
    Process of modifying or transforming data can be done with JS since JS is a fully featured language with DS such as arrays which allows us to sort, filter and aggregate data. Many powerful array methods such as map, filter and reduce.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Storing data: </strong> We can store data in the client or the browser using local storage, session stoage and cookies.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Creating APIs: </strong> Me may also use JS in the server side with NodeJS as well as Deno. 
    <br>
    <br>
    In addition to consume APIs from the front-end, we can create APIs to interact with databases on the back-end. We can use frameworks such as Express to create backend APIs.
    </li>
