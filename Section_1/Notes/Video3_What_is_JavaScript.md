<h2>Video 3: What is Javascript?</h2>

<h3>What is JavaScript?</h3>
<p align = "justify">
JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the web, alongside HTML which is a markup language and is used to structure webpage content and CSS which is used to style this content. JavaScript is what brings life to the frontend or UI of a website or web app and make them dynamic. 
</p>
<p align = "justify">
It can also be used on the server-side to interact with databases and interact with the file system with the Node.js runtime. It is a high-level, interpreted PL that can be used in the client side as well as the server-side. 
</p>

Intepreted? This means it is executed line by line instead of being compiled into machine-code first, hence it is an scripting language.
</p>

<h3>What is JavaScript used for?</h3>
<ol align = "justify">
    <li><strong>DOM manipulation:</strong> You can think of the DOM as a tree-like structure of nodes and everything on the page is a node. Every attribute, HTML tag and every piece of text is a node in the DOM. JS provides methods to dynamically change the content, style and structure of the elements in the DOM. For instance, we can:
    <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Add or remove text from a heading or div</li>
            <li>Change an element's style like the font color</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Event handling:</strong> User actions are called events and JS gives us a way to handle events. We can respond to things like:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Keyboard input</li>
            <li>Mouse clicks, hovers and drags</li>
            <li>Form submissions</li>
        </ul>
    This allows us to create very dynamic interfaces such as modals, dropdown, collapsible contents and so on.
    </li>
    <br>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Asynchronous Requests:</strong> One of the most powerful uses of JS. Used to interact with your backend servers (could be your own) or a public API such as google or youtube API. We can make HTTP requests to fetch data or submit data and this happens without needing to refresh pages.
    <br>
    <br>
    SPAs: Single page applications which are apps that load a single HTML page to make use of asynchronous requests to dynamically load and update content without needing to reload the entire page. This provides a very seamless UI experience. We can use a front-end framework such as Angular, React or Vue. We can also create them with vanilla JS.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Animations and Effects:</strong> Many different ways to create this with JSS and CSS such as libraries such as animate.css and GSAP. Allows developers to create a wide range of animations such as fading and moving elements along a path, scaling, rotating, etc.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Data manipulation: </strong> 
    Process of modifying or transforming data can be done with JS since JS is a fully featured language with DS such as arrays which allows us to sort, filter and aggregate data. Many powerful array methods such as map, filter and reduce.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Storing data: </strong> We can store data in the client or the browser using local storage, session stoage and cookies.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Creating APIs: </strong> Me may also use JS in the server side with NodeJS as well as Deno. 
    <br>
    <br>
    In addition to consume APIs from the front-end, we can create APIs to interact with databases on the back-end. We can use popular frameworks such as Express to create backend APIs.
    </li>
</ol>
<h3>Why should you learn JavaScript?</h3>
<ul align = "justify">
    <li><strong>Popularity: </strong> One of the most widely used languages. Many job opportunities. You may develop web applications, browser-based games, websites, server-side APIs. Allows for colaboration with other developers.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Versatile: </strong> A full-stack language since its used in the back-end and front-end. Technologies such as React Native allow you to create mobile apps and other technologies such as Electron allow you to create Desktop applications such as VSCode as well as Postman which is the HTTP client we will use in this course.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Relatively easy to learn: </strong> Anyone with the desire and motivation can learn JS.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Large community: </strong> JS has a huge reach and many development tools are open-source such as npm (node package manager). There is no shortage of resources or tools when it comes to JS.
    </li>
</ul>
