## Functions, Scope & Execution Context

<p align = "justify">Functions are essential in programming since they allow you to create blocks of code you can execute repeatedly. In this section we will cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Creating basic functions </li>
	<li>Function declarations vs expressions</li>
	<li>Arrow functions </li>
	<li>IIFEs or immediately invoked function expressions</li>
	<li>Scope : Lets you know what context your code is being executed.</li>
	<li> Execution context and call stack: Useful to understand how JS works under the hood. </li>
</ul>
