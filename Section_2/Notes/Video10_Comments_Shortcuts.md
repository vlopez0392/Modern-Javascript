<h2>Comments and shortcuts</h2>

---

<h3>Using comments</h3>
<p align = "justify">
Comments are used to document your code and explaining things in a more human-readable way. Often, many developers work in the same codebase and comments are used to explain what a certain piece of code does.
</p>

<p align = "justify">
Comments are especially important when you are working in a project with a team of developers. You may also comment code that you may not want to delete but yo don't want to execute either.
</p>

<p align = "justify">
You may also use comments to specify a TODO list. In JS we add comments as follows:
</p>

```
//This is a single line comment
//You must add the double slash to comment something
```

<p align = "justify">
Adding a multi-line comment:
</p>

```
/*This is a multiline comment
  Everything between the /* and */ will be commented  
*/
```
